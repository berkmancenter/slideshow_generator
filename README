I suck and deleted my original notes file.

Models:
See config/doctrine

Flow:
Search for a keyword in certain repos (checkboxes under keyword input)
Fill the keyword into each repo search_url_pattern and fetch results
Send results through native result_format parser (xml or json) to get PHP object (or array)
Send object through repo-specific parser to pull out relevant info for each image (id_1, id_2, id_3)
Don't store in database - connect this directly to a view.  Each image in collection will have associated checkbox with concatenated value of from_repo|id_1|id_2|id_3
On form submit, read all the submitted image data and connect to either new or current slideshow, and dump to database
Show the current slideshow with numbers beneath for ordering and submit button
Override that stuff with javascript to allow drag-drop reordering of slides
Show button to view slideshow and direct slideshow link

Have panel throughout to manage particular slideshow

Questions:
Are we connecting this to PIN system, or how else are we allowing access to particular old slideshows? - We're setting up our own user database

Notes:

Parser classes will have to parse every url in the repo class and return standardized PHP objects
